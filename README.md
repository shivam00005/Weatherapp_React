# Weather Web App How & why :interrobang:

The weather app developed using React and Fetch API is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to enter a city name and get real-time weather reports for that city. The app provides weather coverage worldwide, making it an essential tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about weather conditions in different parts of the world.

The app's user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and get the information they need quickly. Users simply need to enter the name of the city they want to get weather reports for, and the app will retrieve the data from the Fetch API and display it in an easy-to-read format.

This weather app was created to help developers learn how to work with React and APIs. By building this app, developers can gain a better understanding of how to use React components, state, and props to create a dynamic user interface. Additionally, the app provides a practical example of how to work with APIs to retrieve and display data in a web application. Overall, this weather app is a valuable resource for developers who want to learn more about building web applications with React and APIs.

## Installation :hammer:

## Getting Started with Create React App :tada:	

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
